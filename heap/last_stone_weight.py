# Last Stone Weight
# Easy
# Topics
# Company Tags
# Hints
# You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] represents the weight of the ith stone.

# We want to run a simulation on the stones as follows:

# At each step we choose the two heaviest stones, with weight x and y and smash them togethers
# If x == y, both stones are destroyed
# If x < y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
# Continue the simulation until there is no more than one stone remaining.

# Return the weight of the last remaining stone or return 0 if none remain.

# Example 1:

# Input: stones = [2,3,6,2,4]

# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# We smash 6 and 4 and are left with a 2, so the array becomes [2,3,2,2].
# We smash 3 and 2 and are left with a 1, so the array becomes [1,2,2].
# We smash 2 and 2, so the array becomes [1].

# Example 2:

# Input: stones = [1,2]

# Output: 1
# Constraints:

# 1 <= stones.length <= 20
# 1 <= stones[i] <= 100
